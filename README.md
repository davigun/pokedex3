# pokedex3
Build with Swift 3 in iOS 10

Purpose

This app was created in order to demo my abilities for creating a nice ui app. This app started out simple, featuring search bar and stack view for details page. The app demonstrates everything great about Swift, from Storyboards, best coding practices, MVC, error handling, parsing CSV data, BGM, usage of 3rd party Public API's (pokedex API using ALAMOFIRE), clean design strategy. It's all in here.
